# Conway's Game of Life (Pygame)

Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by John Horton Conway. It is, essentially, a zero player game. You can read more about it [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

## Prerequisites

You will need to install Pygame to run this. It is recommended that you run the project on a virtual environment, and that you build pygame, rather than installing it with pip (for optimal CPU usage).
Refer to [this](http://www.pygame.org/wiki/CompileUbuntu#Python%203.x%20into%20vihref=rtual%20environment) guide.


## Getting Started

Once you have pygame and the virtual environment setup, clone this repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/PratikshaJain37/Conways-Game-Of-Life.git
```
After making sure you are in the directory which contains the code, run the 'main' script using python3
```
$ cd Conways-Game-Of-Life
$ python3 main.py
```
A pygame window should appear, with a start screen. Click 'Start' to continue.

You can press Pause/Play to control the animation, and even make it go faster/slower! 
Have fun!
